## Explore a project

MoBIE is focused around the idea of **projects** - a project contains all the information
needed to display your data e.g. which images and tables to display, where they are stored etc...

### How to explore an existing project?

Once the MoBIE plugin has been installed (see instructions [here](https://github.com/mobie/mobie-viewer-fiji#install),
you can open a project:

1. In the Fiji search bar, type: "mobie"<br> <img width="460" alt="image" src="./tutorial_images/mobie_command.png"> <br> 
...select 'Open MoBIE Project..' and click [ Run ]
2. Enter the location of the project (a github repository).  
We will use the published 'Platybrowser' project as an example (location: https://github.com/mobie/platybrowser-datasets)

3. The MoBIE viewer is ready to be used:<br><img width="800" alt="image" src="./tutorial_images/ui.png">

The left window contains all the controls for MoBIE, and the right is a [BigDataViewer](https://imagej.net/BigDataViewer)
window allowing you to browse images.

Note: It is also possible to open projects from your local file system (see advanced tutorial)

### Browsing in the viewer

All the controls for BigDataViewer can be found under Help > Show Help in the menu at the top of the 
viewer.

The most important controls are:   
* **[Left click + drag]** Rotate view

* **[Scroll]** Move along z axis
* **[Up / Down arrow keys]** Zoom in and out
