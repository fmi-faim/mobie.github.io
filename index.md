# Welcome to the tutorials for MoBIE!

The MoBIE Fiji viewer is a [Fiji](https://imagej.net/Fiji) plugin allowing easy exploration
of big multi-modal images and associated tabular data.

**Main Features:**
- Smooth browsing of large image data thanks to [BigDataViewer](https://imagej.net/BigDataViewer)
- Overlay many types of images in the same coordinate system (e.g. electron microscopy, light microscopy,
segmentations...)
- Explore tabular data interactively alongside the images they're derived from
- Easy sharing with colleagues (no need to download the raw images!)
- Easy sharing of points of interest in your data e.g. create bookmarks showing selected
views, images and tables for your colleagues to explore
- ... and more!
