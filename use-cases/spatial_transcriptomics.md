# Spatial transcriptomics

Spatial transcriptomics can measure spatially resolved gene expression in tissue. In combination with microscopy imaging data these gene expression maps enable joint analysis of genotype and phenotype of cells, tissues or organs. MoBIE enables joint visualization of spatial transcriptomics data with imaging data through *spotSources*, which can visualize point coordinates and associated measurements stored in a table.
Here we demonstrate the relevant features for the [mouse-embryo-spatial-transcriptomics-project](https://github.com/mobie/mouse-embryo-spatial-transcriptomics-project).
For this example there is also a [video](https://youtu.be/1dDaxOAZ9Sg) that highlights MoBIE's key features for visualizing spatial transcriptomics data.


## Data & project set-up

The data from this publication comes from the publication [Integration of spatial and single-cell transcriptomic data elucidates mouse organogenesis](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-021-01006-2).
