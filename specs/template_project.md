# MoBIE specification

The MoBIE specification describes a valid configuration for the MoBIE viewer. The specification defines four different concepts:
- A `project`, which groups data, for example from the same publication, that can be opened by the MoBIE viewer. It consists of multiple `datasets`.
- A `dataset`, which contains data that can be opened *jointly* by the MoBIE viewer.
- A `source`, which corresponds to a single image data source as well as associated metadata and viewer state.
- A `view`, which describes the viewer state.

The specification is defined via [jsonschema](https://json-schema.org/) and the schema files are located [here](https://github.com/mobie/mobie.github.io/tree/master/schema).
It is versioned, following [the semantic versioning convention](https://semver.org/). The current version is `0.2.0`.

**Using jsonschema:**

The jsonschema files can be used in the following ways:
- Static validation against the schema: using e.g. [jsonschema-python](https://python-jsonschema.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) `jsonschema -i my-dataset-schema.json schema/dataset.schema.json`. See also the [full project validation script](https://github.com/mobie/mobie.github.io/blob/master/scripts/validate_project.py).
- Generate example data from the schema with [fake-schema-cli](https://github.com/atomsfat/fake-schema-cli): `fake-schema schema/dataset.schema.json `

## <a name="project"></a>Project 

The `project` and its associated `datasets` are stored in a directory structure with the project corresponding to the root directory.
This directory must contain the file `project.json`, which must contain a valid [project schema](https://github.com/mobie/mobie.github.io/tree/master/schema/project.schema.json)
See an example project structure, slightly adapted from the [zebrafish-lm project](https://github.com/mobie/zebrafish-lm-datasets):
```
zebrafish-lm/
├── project.json
├── actin
├── cisgolgi
├── lysosomes
├── membrane
├── nuclei
└── trans_golgi
```

### <a name="project-metadata"></a>Project Metadata

The project metadata, stored in `project.json`, has the following structure:
- `datasets`: List of the available datasets. The dataset directory names must match the names in the list. It must contain at least one dataset.
- `defaultDataset`: The dataset that will be opened when the MoBIE viewer is started for this project.
- `project`: Additional project metadata.
    - `description`: Description of this project.
    - `references`: List of references for this project.
- `specVersion`: The MoBIE specification version of this project.

For the zebrafish-lm project the `project.json` looks like this:
```json
{
  "datasets": [
    "actin",
    "cisgolgi",
    "lysosomes",
    "membrane",
    "nuclei",
    "trans_golgi"
  ],
  "defaultDataset": "membrane",
  "project": {
    "description": "A quantitative atlas of the cellular architecture for the zebrafish posterior lateral line primoridum.",
    "references": ["https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.55913"]
  },
  "specVersion": "0.2.0"
}
```

### <a name="project-storage"></a>Local & Remote Projects

Projects can be either stored locally or hosted on a remote object store.
In addition, the `image data`, i.e. the image data in one of the [supported data formats](#data) and `metadata`, corresponding to the json files for this project and [tables](#tables) 
can be accessed from different storage locations for one project.

In more detail, MoBIE currently supports the following storage options:
- filesystem: can store `image data` and `metadata`.
- s3 object store: can store `image data` and `metadata`; public and private buckets are supported.
- github: can only store `metadata`, `image data` must be loaded from object store.

This enables different combinations of hosting a project, see also this [figure](fig-storage):
<ol type="a">
<li>only on filesystem: project is only available locally; this is the best mode for development.</li>
<li>only on s3 object store: project is self-contained in object store and can be shared with collaborators privately (using a privat bucket) or shared publicly (using a public bucket).</li>
<li>on github and s3 object store: the metadata is stored on github, which also serves as entrypoint for the viewer. The image sources are stored on the s3 bucket. This set-up has the advantage that metadata is under version control.</li>
</ol>
