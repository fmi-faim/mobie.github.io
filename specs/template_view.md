## <a name="view"></a>View

A `view` stores all metadata necessary to fully reproduce a MoBIE viewer state.

### <a name="view-grid"></a>Grid Views

Grid views can be used to arrange sources in a grid automatically. They must have at least one associated table. 
Tables for grid views should be stored as tab separated values, but may also be comma separated. They must contain the column `grid_id`, which is
used for navigation in the viewer, and must contain at least one more column.
The `grid_id` column indexes the 2d grid position, assuming the same order of sources as in the `sources` list given in the view metadata.

See an example grid view table for 4 grid positions that also gives the presence of different organelles for each position.
```tsv
grid_id mitochondria    vesicles    golgi   er
0   1   0   1   0
1   1   0   1   1
2   0   0   0   1
3   0   1   0   1
```

### <a name="view-metadata"></a>View Metadata

The metadata for the views of a dataset is specified in the field `views` of `dataset.json` (see also [dataset metadata](#dataset-metadata)).
`views` contains a mapping of view names to [view metadata](https://github.com/mobie/mobie.github.io/tree/master/schema/view.schema.json).

Additional views can be stored as json files with the field `views` mapping view names to metadata in the folder `misc/views`

The metadata entries have the following structure (see below for an example json file):
