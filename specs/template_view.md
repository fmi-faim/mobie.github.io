## <a name="view"></a>View

A `view` stores all metadata necessary to fully reproduce a MoBIE viewer state.

### <a name="view-grid"></a>Grid Views

Grid views can be used to arrange sources in a grid automatically. They must have an associated table, that is
used for navigation in the viewer, and can also store additional properties for individual grid positions.
The table specification is the same as for the [segmentation tables](#tables), except for a different layout required in the default table,
which must contain the column `grid_id` and may contain additional arbitrary columns.

See an example grid view table for 4 grid positions that also gives the presence of different organelles for each position.
```tsv
grid_id mitochondria    vesicles    golgi   er
0   1   0   1   0   0
0   1   0   1   1   0
0   2   0   0   1   1
0   3   1   0   1   1
```

### <a name="view-metadata"></a>View Metadata

The metadata for the views of a dataset is specified in the field `views` of `dataset.json` (see also [dataset metadata](#dataset-metadata)).
`views` contains a mapping of view names to [view metadata](https://github.com/mobie/mobie.github.io/tree/master/schema/view.schema.json).

Additional views can be stored as json files with the field `bookmarks` mapping view names to metadata in the folder `misc/bookmarks`

The metadata entries have the following structure (see below for an example json file):
